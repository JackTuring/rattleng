# Run this after the raw dataset has been loaded into the variable
# `ds` in R and before the R data template script is run (on leaving
# the DATASET tab).  This script cleans and prepares the dataset
# according to any configured cleaning and needs to do this before we
# run the template script. After the cleaning we generate the META
# DATA to be scraped for the ROLES display. The `dataset_template.R`
# script will be run after the data within the dataset has been
# prepared, which may be called again after, for example, a TRANSFORM.
