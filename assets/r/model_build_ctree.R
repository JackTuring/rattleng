## 20250116 gjw Choose to use partykit (2015) over the older party
## (2008) package. The partykit package can do much more and is a
## framework for supporting other tree packages including rpart, rweka,
## and pmml. It's ctree is a new and improved reimplementations of
## conditional inference trees. See
## https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partykit/partykit.pdf and
## https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/party/party.pdf.

##
## The ctree function is available in both the party and partykit
## packages in R. While both packages provide similar functionality for
## conditional inference trees, there are some differences between them.
##
## Party Package: The party package is an older package that provides a
## basic implementation of conditional inference trees. It uses a
## recursive partitioning approach to build trees and provides a simple
## way to visualize and interpret the results.  Partykit Package: The
## partykit package is a more recent package that provides a more
## comprehensive and flexible implementation of conditional inference
## trees. It includes additional features such as support for
## multivariate responses, improved visualization tools, and the ability
## to handle larger datasets. The partykit package also provides a more
## robust and efficient algorithm for building trees, which can handle
## complex interactions and non-linear relationships between variables.
## In terms of the ctree function specifically, the partykit package
## provides a more flexible and customizable implementation. The ctree
## function in partykit allows users to specify a wide range of options,
## including the test statistic, splitting criterion, and pruning
## method. Additionally, the partykit package provides a range of
## visualization tools, including plots of the tree structure, node
## information, and predicted probabilities.
##
## Overall, while both packages provide similar functionality, the
## partykit package is generally considered to be more comprehensive and
## flexible, and is likely to be the better choice for most
## users. However, the party package may still be useful for simple
## applications or for users who are already familiar with its
## functionality.
##
## Itâ€™s worth noting that the partykit package is designed to be backward
## compatible with the party package, so users who have existing code
## that uses the party package can easily transition to using the
## partykit package.
##
## In summary, the main differences between the party and partykit
## packages are:
##
## Flexibility: The partykit package provides a more flexible and
## customizable implementation of conditional inference trees.
##
## Visualization: The partykit package provides a range of
## visualization tools, including plots of the tree structure, node
## information, and predicted probabilities.
##
## Robustness: The partykit package provides a more robust and
## efficient algorithm for building trees, which can handle complex
## interactions and non-linear relationships between variables.
##
## Compatibility: The partykit package is designed to be backward
## compatible with the party package, making it easy for users to
## transition to the new package.
