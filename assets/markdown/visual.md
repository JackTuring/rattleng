# Visual Data Analysis

Visual data analysis presents datasets through visual representations
that include graphs and charts. Typically they provide an
understandong of how the values of a variable are distributed. That
is, the **distribution** of the data. 

By visualising data you can identify patterns in the data that in
themselves can provide insights, and even actionable understandings
from the data.

Through data visualisation you can gain an understanding of trends
over time, outliers or unusual observations, and patterns. All of this
contributes to your understanding of the data and the task at hand.

I like to refer to this as living and breathing your data. It is
essential to understand your data as you begin to analyse and model
it.

Here you can choose a variables and different types of charts will be
generated to present the data from different perspectives. A variety
of different charts will be generated for a single variable.
