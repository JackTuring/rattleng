# Visual Data Analysis

Visual data analysis presents datasets through visual representations
that include graphs and charts. Typically they provide an
understandong of how the values of a variable are distributed. That
is, the **distribution** of the data. 

By visualising data you can identify patterns in the data that in
themselves can provide insights, and even actionable understandings
from the data.

Through data visualisation you can gain an understanding of trends
over time, outliers or unusual observations, and patterns. All of this
contributes to your understanding of the data and the task at hand.

I like to refer to this as living and breathing your data. It is
essential to understand your data as you begin to analyse and model
it.

A variety of R packages like
[ggplot2](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2) are
utilised to build a variety of charts, plots, and graphs.

For each visualisation you can choose a variable and review the
distribution of its values. Many different types of charts are
generated for the chosen variable to present the data from different
perspectives. While reviewing a specific chart you can change the
selected variable to review it's distribution.
