The **log** tab captures all interactions with Rattle as an *R script*.

You can **Save** the log to file (e.g., *script.R*) to run
independently in R. To run a file as an R script use the Rscript
command line. Within R itself, like the R Console or RStudio run the
command using `source('script.R')`.
