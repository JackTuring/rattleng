The **log** tab captures all interactions with Rattle as an *R script*.

You can **Save Log** to file (e.g., *model.R*) to run the script in R,
independent of Rattle. To run the file as an R script use the Rscript
command line or , through the R Console or RStudio run the command
using `source('model.R')`.
