# Missing Data Analysis

Missing values are important to the data scientist. They can result in
some models builders failing, and others generating erroneous results.
Handling missing data is crucial to ensure quality and reliable
analyses.

Missing data can result in:

+ Bias and Misguided Conclusions: Missing data can introduce bias,
  leading to incorrect conclusions. If not handled properly, it may
  affect statistical tests and model performance1.

+ Reduced Statistical Power: Missing data reduces the statistical
  power of tests. Incomplete information may lead to underestimation
  or overestimation of effects, affecting the validity of results.

+ Model Performance: Machine learning models trained on incomplete
  data may perform poorly. Proper handling ensures robust and accurate
  predictions.

+ Data Integrity: Addressing missing values ensures the integrity of
  your analyses. Imputation (substituting reasonable guesses) or data
  removal are common strategies2.

+ Remember, understanding the types of missing data (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
  helps choose appropriate methods for handling them
