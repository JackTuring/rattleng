# Statistical Tests

Statistics plays a crucial role in providing insights into our
data. The statistical tests supported here allow us to compare the
distributions of values of two variables at a time.

**Two-sample tests** compare the distribution of the values of two
independent variables to determine whether they come from the
same population and the same statistical properties. 

**Paired two-sample tests** assume that we have two samples or
observations, and that we are testing for a change, usually from one
time period to another.

## Available Tests

**Distribution of the Data**

The **Kolomogorov-Smirnov** test is a non-parametric test of the
hypothesis that the distributions are different.

The **Wilcoxon Signed Rank** test is a    non-parametric test of the
hypothesis that the paired samples have different distributions.

**Location of the Average**

The two-sample **t-Test** is a parametric test used to compare the
means of two independent groups to see if there is a statistically
significant difference between them. The test assumes that data are
continuous and approximately normally distributed, that the two
variables are independent of each other, and that the variances of the
two variables are equal (standard t-test).

The **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum** test is a     non-parametric test of the
hypothesis that the medians are different.

**Variation in the Data**

The **f-Test** is a parametric test of the hypothesis that the
variances are different.

**Correlation**

The **Pearsons** correlation is a test of the hypothesis that the
values from paired samples are correlated.
