# Univariate Dataset Summary

The **Summary** feature provides various univariate summarises of the
loaded dataset. As a data scientist you will review the summaries of
the dataset looking for anything that appears odd or unexpected.

For **numeric data** the univariate summaries will often provide the
minimum and maximum values, together with first and third quartiles as
well as the median (the second quartile) and the mean.

For **categoric data** the univariate summaries will often provide the
frequency of the categoric values, usually sorted from the most
frequent to the least frequent.  For some summaries, only the top few
categoric values will be listed.

A count of **missing values** is often shown for any variables with
missing values.
