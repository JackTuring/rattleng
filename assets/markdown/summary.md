# Univariate Dataset Summary

The first task for a data scientist, on loading their dataset into
RattleNG, is to understand what the data looks like and how it is
distributed. I call this *living and breathing your data*.


Back on the **Dataset** tab we saw an initial glimpse of the dataset
&mdash; the first few values from the dataset were listed there.

Here in the *Summary** feature of the **Explore** tab we further
explore how the values of each of our variables in the dataset are
distribution. That is, we explore the **distributions**. This provides
much more insight into our data leading to our better understanding of
the data and leading us to begin to ask questions of the data. Like
why does the data look like how it does? Are there any obvious or even
subtle oddities about the data.

This **Summary** feature summarises the data values for all
non-ignored variables from the dataset. For factors we see the number
of levels the variable has, the data type, and the number of missing
values in that variables, and so on.  The various pages of this
Summary delve into the factors and their levels, summaries of the
distribution of each variable, and some of the typical measures that
we use to gain insight.

You will see, for example, measures called **Kurtosis** and
**Skewness** got numeric variables that allow us to measure the spread
of the data. We can compare this across the available numeric
variables.

Through a review of the summaries of the data you are looking for
anything that looks odd or unexpected.
