# Exploring Data

The first task for a data scientist, on loading their dataset into
RattleNG, is to understand what the data looks like and how it is
distributed. I call this *living and breathing your data*.

Back on the **Dataset** tab we saw an initial glimpse of the dataset
&mdash; the first few values from the dataset were listed there.

Here in the **Explore** tab we can further explore, for example, how
the values of each of our variables in the dataset are distributed
&ndash; explore the **distributions**. This provides much more insight
into our data leading to our better understanding of the data and
leading us to begin to ask questions of the data. Like why does the
data look like how it does? Are there any obvious or even subtle
oddities about the data.

The **Summary** feature summarises the data values for all non-ignored
variables from the dataset. For factors we see the number of levels
the variable has, the data type, and the number of missing values in
that variables, and so on.  The various pages of this Summary delve
into the factors and their levels, summaries of the distribution of
each variable, and some of the typical measures that we use to gain
insight. You will also see, for example, measures called **Kurtosis**
and **Skewness** for numeric variables that allow us to measure the
spread of the data. We can compare this across the available numeric
variables.
